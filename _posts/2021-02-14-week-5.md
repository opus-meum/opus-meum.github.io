## Book 3
#### Oathbringer
###### Brandon Sanderson

Book 3 of The Stormlight Archive. The infamous Voidbringers are here, Roshar is in chaos, mankind is divided. Dalinar must unite them if they are to have any hope of surviving the assault of the Voidbringers, led by the evil of Odium.

#### Reflection
<div style = "text-align: justify;

My re-reading of these novels continues to diminish my opinion of Brandon Sanderson as writer. Too many of his paragraphs are emphasised using trite idioms or clich√©s. Additionally, the weaving of sci-fi-esq influences such as the overly impractical ship designs as illustrated in the official artwork, into a ostensibly high-fantasy world built on a nominally Earth-like planet are frustrating.

My return to this series was driven by the anticipation of the then upcoming Rhythm of War, Book 4 of the archive. However, after wading through three books greater than 1000 pages in length, I am disillusioned with the series and the thought of engaging with a fourth book is daunting rather than exciting.

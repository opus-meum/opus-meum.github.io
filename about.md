#### Here's the "What"
Life long learning is important. There is no better way to achieve this than by reading. This site will track what I've read, what it says, and what I think it means.

#### Here's the "Aim"
* Two papers per week.<br>
* A book every two weeks.<br>
* The most signigicant news article read per week (if such a thing exists).

#### Here's the "Why"
* To grow in knowledge. Both in quantity read, and in the derivation of value thourgh succinct summary and analysis.<br>
* To improve my writing.<br>
* To visually track what I spend my time reading.<br>
* To serve a reference point for future review.<br>


#### Here's the "When"
<div style = "text-align: justify;
  text-indent: 0em;
  text-justify: inter-word;">
Weekly. Published every Sunday afternoon. I hope. Maybe not if I'm on leave. Or if I'm swamped by marking. Or have COVID. You get the point.

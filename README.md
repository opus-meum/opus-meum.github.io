This is a blog about the things I read. Updated weekly, here you will find reviews of Conference Papers, Journal Articles, White Papers, Reports, Dissertations and Theses, News Articles, Books, etc.

It's primarily for myself: I'd like to increase the breadth and quantity of my reading and so a visual track is nice. I also want to practice the art of review. Review forces summary and analysis. Improving these skills is essential to growing in knowledge and understanding. Along the way, my writing should also improve.

Join if you're interested. Published every Sunday. 

This is evidently a work in progress and so the site is like to be in a contstant state of flux regarding design and capabilities. 

Feedback and questions are welcomed. Contact details found on the *Author* page.

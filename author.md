I am a Mechatronics Lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Cape Town (UCT). I am also a PhD candidate with the Department of Electrical Engineering at UCT. I have an [MSc. (Eng)](https://github.com/opus-meum/masters) in Mechanical Engineering (with Distinction) and a BSc. (Eng) in Electro-Mechanical Engineering (with First-Class Honors).

I am interested primarily in engineering education and love the teaching aspects of my job. From a techincal interests perspective, embedded systems are the flavour of the month for me. My research consists of the development of a novel, environmental sensor network aimed for deployment in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica.<br><br>
I've developed a curriculum framework for the [Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering](http://www.mecheng.uct.ac.za/mec/ug/bsc-elec-mech-eng) degree at UCT.<br>
I've developed robotics curriculum and a [low cost educational robot](https://i.imgur.com/zl1sJ1g.jpg) for [CodeSpace Academy](https://www.codespace.co.za).<br>
I've consulted for [Melisizwe Computer Lab Project](https://melisizwe.co.za).<br>
I've written firmware for [Engineer Simplicity](http://www.engineersimplicity.com).<br>
I've written multi-threaded software in C# for control systems design and simulation.<br>
I've maintained a website for [Church-on-Main](https://churchonmain.org.za).<br>
I've designed and built [control systems and mechatronic platforms](https://imgur.com/a/ePyzVF8) to automatically track astrononical objects from moving vehicles, [educational robots](https://imgur.com/a/t6GHrvK), motion triggered lighting solutions, automatic animal feeders, and I'm in the process of automating my home espresso machine.<br>
I love speciality coffee, reading, hiking.<br>
I think that's enough.
